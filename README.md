# Learning How To Code

This is a project I was thinking of to give new coders small projects to learn how to code across multiple languages.  Many of my friends ask me when they want to learn how to code, and I figured I'd just write some tutorials to help them with it.

# Getting Started

TBD

# Design Decisions

## Choosing a language

I wanted to make sure that this can be used across multiple languages to teach new people (and teach others rust).  Python will be the main language, followed by other languages I'm familiar with and can help with (Java, Rust, Kotlin?, Ruby?).  It'll eventually have to explain basic concepts, and how they differ when choosing a language.

## Skill Level

I want to make this from absolute beginner, to someone who's taken a 100 level software course.  I'd appreciate feedback from some of the people I give this to at that level.

## Interface

Command line tools are not the easiest for people.  But, I'm old fashioned when it comes to having people know basic command line tools.  This will try to as well teach git, since it's on Github.
